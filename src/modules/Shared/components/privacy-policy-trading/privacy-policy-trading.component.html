            <p>
            Beige Ventures LLP does not provide financial advice and investors are encouraged to consult with their personal financial advisors.
            </p>
            <p>
            All investing and trading involves risk, including the possible loss of money invested, and past performance does not guarantee future performance. Historical returns, expected returns, and probability projections are provided for informational and illustrative purposes only, and may not reflect actual future performance.
            </p>
            <p>
            All investments, and trading, including Forex, Cryptocurrency and Commodities, are speculative in nature and involve substantial risk of loss. We encourage our users to invest and trade assets carefully. We also encourage users to get personal advice from their own professional investment advisors and to make independent investigations before acting on information that we publish. Much of our information is derived directly from algorithms, data, information published by companies or submitted to governmental agencies on which we believe are reliable, but are without our independent verification. Therefore, we cannot assure that the information is accurate or complete. We do not in any way warrant or guarantee the success of any action taken in reliance on our statements or recommendations.
            </p>
            <p>
            Past performance is not indicative of future results. All investments carry risk and all investment decisions of an individual remain the responsibility of that individual. There is no guarantee that systems, indicators, or signals will result in profits or that they will not result in losses. All investors are advised to fully understand all risks associated with any kind of investing they choose to do.
            </p>
            <p>
            All your trade execution, trading ideas or investments are your own responsibility and Beige Ventures LLP is not responsible for your actions.
            </p>
            <p>
            We accept no liability for any losses or damages you may incur—this means that you alone are responsible for your actions in any trading or investing activities.
            </p>
            <p>
            Nothing in the Navigator should be construed as an offer, recommendation, or solicitation to buy or sell any security.
